The Project Organizer App works as a bulletin board for a company to post and edit projects across a team. The app uses React to effectively manage state and event handling to post, view, and filter projects by keyword.  This can increase efficiency for a company across a group of workers who need organizing help.

The interface is very simple. Input your project title in the title field, and a description of it in the description field. After verifying your info, click Add Project and watch it become posted on the Projects List Bulletin Board. After project is completed, feel free to delete it from the board using the delete project button located on each project card.

Happy Working!!!
